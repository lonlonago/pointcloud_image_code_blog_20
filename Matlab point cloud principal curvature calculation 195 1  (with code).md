#  I. Introduction 

>  Definition of principal curvature: There are infinite orthogonal curvatures at a point on the surface. There is a curve such that the curvature of the curve is maximal. This curvature is maximal Kmax, and the curvature perpendicular to the surface of maximal curvature is minimal Kmin. These two curvature properties are dominant curvatures. They represent the extremes of normal curvature. Here refer to the practice in PCL to calculate the principal curvature value of each point in the out-point cloud based on the normal vector of the point cloud.
