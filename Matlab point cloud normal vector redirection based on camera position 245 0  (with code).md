#  I. Introduction 

>  The method specifies the position of the camera, first obtain the vector of each point pointing to the position, and then calculate the angle between the point and its normal vector based on these vectors. If the angle is less than 90 degrees, the normal vector remains unchanged. Otherwise, flip.
