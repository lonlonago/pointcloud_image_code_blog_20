#  I. Introduction 

>  This function is relatively simple. According to the specified directory, all the point cloud files in the directory are merged into one file for output. The function is very simple, mainly to familiarize yourself with the code. 

#  Implementation code 

##  2.1 Standard method 

>  Use the function pcmerge provided in Matlab.

 ```  
##  2.1 Array method 

>  Although the above method can merge point clouds, it will downsample. Sometimes we don't want to downsample, so we can use the following method without using the pcmerge function.
