#  I. Introduction 

>  The principle is very simple and is mainly divided into three steps: 1. First, according to the center and axis of the cylinder, the point cloud is projected in a plane (axial). 2. Perform a circular search for the projected point cloud. 3. Extract the points in the cylindrical area of the point cloud.
