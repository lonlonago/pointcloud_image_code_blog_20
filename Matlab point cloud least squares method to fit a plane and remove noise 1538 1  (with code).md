#  I. Introduction 

>  The idea of this algorithm is very simple. It is to fit a more suitable plane by removing some outliers. The specific process is as follows: 

1. First, use the least squares method to fit the initial value of a plane coefficient. 2. Calculate the distance from all valid points to the fitting plane 

           d 

           i 

         d_i 

     Di and calculate the standard deviation of these distances 

          s 

         \sigma 

     Sigma. 3. Assuming that the distribution of the data conforms to the normal distribution, here we consider that when 

           d 

           i 

>  

          3 

          âˆ— 

          s 

         d_i>3*\sigma 

     Di > 3 * sigma, this point is an outlier, which is eliminated here. 4. Then use the remaining points to recalculate the plane coefficients. 5. Repeat steps 1-4 until the distance of all points is less than the threshold we specify, then the algorithm stops.
