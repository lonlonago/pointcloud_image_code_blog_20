>  The principle is very simple and is mainly divided into three steps: 1. First, according to the center and axis of the cylinder, the point cloud is projected in a plane (axial). 2. Perform a circular search for the projected point cloud. 3. Extract the points in the cylindrical area of the point cloud.

1. First, use the least squares method to fit the initial value of a plane coefficient. 2. Calculate the distance from all valid points to the fitting plane

#  I. Introduction 

>  This method is also very interesting, and its approximate process is as follows: filter each dimension in the point cloud separately ( 

          x 

          , 

          y 

          , 

          z 

         x,y,z 

     X, y, z), replacing the local area value with the median value of each dimension in the local neighborhood. This idea has strong applicability, and often high-dimensional or lower-dimensional data can be filtered using this method. 

#  II. Relevant parameters 

>  The PCMedian function in Matlab will be used here. 

Dimensions: Specifies the point cloud dimension of interest, specified as an integer vector in the range [1 3]. 1, 2, 3 correspond to the x, y, and z axes respectively. Must be specified in ascending order. 

FilterSize: This parameter is mainly for ordered point clouds, the size of the median filter for an organized point cloud, specified as an odd number in the range [3, N]. N is the smallest channel dimension in the point cloud. 

Radius: This parameter is mainly for disordered point clouds. The neighborhood radius of the disordered point cloud is specified as a positive value. The calculation time increases when there are many points within the specified radius. Therefore, for dense point clouds, a larger radius value results in a higher calculation time.

This curvature is maximal Kmax, and the curvature perpendicular to the surface of maximal curvature is minimal Kmin. These two curvature properties are dominant curvatures. They represent the extremes of normal curvature.

#  I. Introduction 

>  There are many ways to represent rotation in three-dimensional space, and the axis angle is a very classic way of expressing it. Although the Euler angle method of representing rotation is very common, the Euler angle has the problem of universal locking, so the axis angle rotation is more suitable for rotation use. The principle is also very clear, as follows: 

>  First, let's assume that an axis passes through the origin 

          u 

          = 

          ( 

          x 

          , 

          y 

          , 

          z 

           ) 

           T 

         u=(x,y,z)^T 

     U = (x, y, z) T, a vector 

          v 

         v 

     V Rotate a certain angle along this axis 

          i 

         \theta 

     Theta, transform to 

           v

 Among them, the above 

          u 

         u 

     U only represents the direction, and its modulus is meaningless. To define a direction in three-dimensional space, only two quantities are needed, that is, the angle between any two coordinate axes. The longitude and latitude of the earth are the simplest example. Since 

          u 

         u 

     The die length of u is meaningless, so it is agreed here that 

          u 

         u 

     U is the unit vector, which facilitates the following calculations. 

>  Ok, after a general understanding of the representation of axial angular rotation, how should we implement rotation from one vector to another? Here we need to 

          v 

         v 

     V is decomposed, which is also our usual method when dealing with vectors. Here we can 

          v 

         v 

     V decomposed parallel to the axis of rotation

#  I. Introduction 

>  One expression that cannot be avoided in three-dimensional rotation is the quaternion. A big problem with Euler's angle in three-dimensional space is its existence of a universal lock, that is, when the pitch angle is Â± 90 Â°, the first rotation and the third rotation will use the same axis, causing the system to lose a degree of freedom (from 3 rotations to 2 rotations, as shown in the figure below). This is called the singularity problem, and it also exists in other forms of Euler's angle. In theory, it can be proved that as long as you want to use 3 real numbers to express three-dimensional rotation, you will inevitably encounter the singularity problem.

##  1.1 Basic knowledge 

>  In order to solve this problem, we need to use the concept of quaternions. Essentially, quaternions still belong to the category of complex numbers, the only difference is that quaternions have three imaginary parts, while complex numbers have only one, so all quaternions can be expressed as: 

Of which: 

![avatar]( 82ee436fede64a2e84a26260e90e43fe.png) 

>  In analogy with complex numbers, quaternions are actually pairs based on { 

          1 

          , 

          i 

          , 

          j 

          , 

          k 

         1,i,j,k 

     A linear combination of 1, i, j, k}, so it can also be written as a vector: 

If the real part is separated from the imaginary part, it can be written as: 

>  The process is very simple. You can learn about it casually on the Internet. Let's focus on the multiplication of quaternions. The multiplication between quaternions is special. It does not obey the commutative law, but obeys the associative law and distributive law. This is similar to the calculation of matrices. It also has the difference between left multiplication and right multiplication. So, if there are two quaternions 

           q 

           1 

          = 

          a 

          + 

          b 

          i 

          + 

          c 

          j 

          + 

          d 

          k 

          and 

           q 

           2 

          = 

          e 

          + 

          f 

          i 

          + 

          g 

          j 

          + 

          h 

          k 

         q_1=a+bi+cj+dkå’Œq_2=e+fi+gj+hk 

     Q1 = a + bi + cj + dk and q2 = e + fi + gj + hk, the product of which can be written as: 

![avatar]( c325983b4dc8484da994b0e66a8ad526.png) 

 To simplify it, we can get: 

We can also conclude that: 

>  Observe the above equation, here let 

          v 

          = 

          [ 

          b 

          , 

          c 

          , 

          d 

          ] 

          , 

          u 

          = 

          [ 

          f 

          , 

          g 

          , 

          h 

          ] 

         v=[b,c,d],u=[f,g,h] 

     V = [b, c, d], u = [f, g, h], we can also use 

          u 

          , 

          v 

         u,v 

     U, v simplify it: 

It can be obtained that: 

This result is also known as the GraÅ¾mann product. 

>  In addition, it is also necessary to understand the pure quaternion and its inverse, the former can be expressed as 

            v 

            â€² 

           = 

           [

           v 

           ] 

          v'=[0,v] 

      V â€² = [0, v], that is, the real part is 0 and only the imaginary part is left. If two pure quaternions 

           v 

            

          = 

          [

         \ thing {v} = [0, v],\ thing {u} = [0, u] 

     v

=[0,v],u

= [0, u] multiplied to get: 

>  As for its inverse, we can compare it to a matrix, namely 

           q 

            âˆ’ 

            1

          = 

          0 

          ) 

         q^{-1}q=qq^{-1}=1(q!=0) 

     Q âˆ’ 1q = qq âˆ’ 1 = 1 (q! = 0), if you directly solve for a 

          q 

         q 

     The inverse of q is not easy, but we can use its conjugate 

           q 

           âˆ— 

          = 

          a

          d 

          k 

         q^*=a-bi-cj-dk 

     To solve the problem, the conjugate quaternion has a very useful property: 

As you can see, the final result is a real number. 

>  After that, it can be easily concluded that: 

It can be easily found that the inversion of the quaternion is much simpler than the inversion of the matrix, which can speed up the computational efficiency of rotation in the computer.

Mainly because in general, the position with the smaller curvature value is relatively flat, and growing from the flattest area can reduce the number of finally divided point clouds. 3. Traverse each seed point in the seed point set to find the seed point

     Near point of Pi 

           N 

           j 

         N_j 

     Nj, test the angle of the normal vector between the seed point and the neighboring point, if this angle is less than the smoothing threshold we set, then the neighboring point 

           N 

           j 

         N_j 

     Nj is added to the class point set C; and if the curvature of the neighboring point is less than the curvature threshold we set, it is added to the seed pointset. until all neighboring points are 

           N 

           j 

         N_j 

     Nj and seed points 

           P 

           i 

         P_i 

     After the Pi comparison, the 

           P 

           i 

         P_i 

     Pi is removed from the seed point set and the process is repeated until the seed point set is empty. At this time, the point set C is the result of clustering the local area content according to the curvature. 4. Find the next seed point again and repeat the process in 1-3 until all points are traversed and the algorithm ends.
