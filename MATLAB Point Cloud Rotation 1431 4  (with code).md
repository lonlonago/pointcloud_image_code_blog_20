#  I. Introduction 

Note: Only rotation matrices are discussed here, not quaternion-related rotation operations 

>  Any point cloud rotation can be described using three rotation angles around the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis (specifically the rigid transformation here), so we can achieve the desired point cloud rotation operation through these three angles.
