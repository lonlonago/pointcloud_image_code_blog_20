#  I. Introduction 

>  The principle here refers to the process of cylindrical projection in PCL, which is divided into two steps: (1) First solve the out-point 

          p 

         p 

     P coordinates on the axis 

          p 

          p 

         pp 

     Pp. (2) based on 

          p 

          p 

         pp 

     PP to 

          p 

         p 

     The direction of p can solve the projection coordinates on the cylindrical surface 

          p 

          r 

          o 

          j 

         proj 

     proj.
