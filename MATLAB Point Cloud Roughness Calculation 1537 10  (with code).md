#  I. Introduction 

>  The principle of calculating the roughness value is very simple, that is, first obtain the neighborhood point set of a point, then use the neighborhood point set to fit a plane, and finally calculate the standard deviation of the distance from the neighborhood point set to the plane. This standard deviation is the roughness of the point. For details, please refer to References [1].
