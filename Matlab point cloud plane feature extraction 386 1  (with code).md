#  I. Introduction 

>  There are various geometric features in the point cloud. Here, based on the neighborhood covariance of each point, the basic geometric features of the point are obtained (as shown in the figure below). Although this approach cannot extract the various parts of the out-point cloud well, it can be used as a means of data preprocessing.
